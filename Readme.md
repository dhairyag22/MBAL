### MBAL

The project focuses on Material Balance Analysis (MBA) using the MBAL software by Petroleum Experts. The objective was to estimate Original Oil in Place (OOIP), understand reservoir drive mechanisms, and analyze depletion trends using historical pressure and production data (aggregated from the same field studied in the Performance Analysis project).

### Methodology

* Software Used: MBAL (Petroleum Experts) â€“ Material Balance Module.

* Assumptions: Single-tank system, homogeneous & isotropic reservoir.

* Steps Followed:
    1. Defined fluid properties, tank parameters,   reservoir characteristics.
    2. Input production history and validated data.
    3. Used analytical history matching to plot Tank Pressure vs. Cumulative Oil Production.
    4. Estimated OOIP through regression and matching.

### Key Results

* OOIP Estimated: ~4.80 MMSTB.

* Pressure Decline: From ~5155 psig to below 2000 psig, showing strong depletion drive.

* Drive Mechanism: Reservoir operating under depletion drive (no active aquifer, no initial gas cap).

* Insight: Recovery efficiency is limited without pressure support, highlighting the potential need for pressure maintenance or EOR strategies.

### Deliverables

* *PDF Report* with step-by-step MBAL workflow.
* *Final plot visualization* (Tank Pressure vs. Cumulative Production).
